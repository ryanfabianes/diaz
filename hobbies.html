									<h1>Taking Photographs</h1>
								</header>
										<span class="image left special"><img src="images/photo.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>First, let me tell you why I like the hobby. The camera is a simple device, that lets you control focus, the amount, and intensity of light hitting a film. Yet the pictures the camera takes are so much more than just depictions. A picture can set a mood and inspire emotions. A picture can tell a story. Photography is so artful, yet it has principles and order. The art is in finding the subject. The order is in manipulating the device to render the scene. I have applied many of the qualities of photography to my life.

There's order and procedure in taking a picture. It's just like a science experiment. Using the first photo as a control, I can manipulate some variables to reach my final product. Using a keen and sensitive eye, I can hypothesize the right settings; when the picture isn't successful, I can learn, adjust and try again. Through this process, the perfect picture is often a result of its previous unsuccessful versions. I have applied the same perseverance I have pursuing the best pictures to my life. For example, I did terribly in my sophomore AP chemistry class. Learning from my poor performance, I relearned the subject last summer and enrolled in organic chemistry at my local community college. This time, the subject was even harder but I persevered through it..</p>

										<h3>Pretending to be Happy</h3>
										<p>
											I am the type of person who is jolly, cheerful and loud sometimes I never get tired making jokes or even making fun of others. I never forget to wear a big smile everyday because I know that my smile is like a virus it can infect or it can transmit to everyone. But sometimes I also wear a fake smile this smile can never be transmitted because it harm everyone, but I always try my best to make the biggest fake smile so that it can be a more realistic.
